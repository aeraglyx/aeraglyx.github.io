> To my knowledge Bumper Bois were originally developed by [Wheel Fun Stuff](https://www.wheelfunstuff.com/). I made my own, but did not come up with them! 


## Design

The shape was quite simple. I modeled it in Fusion 360, which I highly recommend for these types of projects. I settled on having the end go directly through power button / charging port at a right angle (75 mm from the tip of the rails). This makes it easier to cut sidekicks and also slightly protects the aforementioned holes.


## 3D Printing

As suggested by [Riddim Rider](https://riddimrider.one/) I tried Fillamentum Flexfill TPU 98A which worked flawlessly. Ultimaker Cura was used on BIQU B1 3D printer (with modified extruder for printing flexibles). Here are some of my settings:

- Speed / Travel - 20 / 200 mm/s
- Layer Height - 0.16 mm
- Infill - Gyroid at 12.5 %
- Retraction - Off
- Combing Mode - All
- Flow - 106 %
- Fan Speed - 50%
- Coasting - 0.04 mm<sup>3</sup>
