## 3D Printing

As suggested by [Riddim Rider](https://riddimrider.one/) I tried Fillamentum Flexfill TPU 98A which worked flawlessly. Ultimaker Cura was used on BIQU B1 3D printer (bowden style + modified extruder). Here are my settings:

- Speed / Travel - 20 / 200 mm/s
- Layer Height - 0.16 mm
- Retraction - Off
- Combing Mode - All
- Coasting Volume - 0.04 mm<sup>3</sup>
- Fan Speed - 50%
